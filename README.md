# Covid 19  in Africa - analysis

## Project Overview 
COVID 19 pandemic  caused havoc and instability in the world. Even the most developed countries were not spared from its wrath. The most developed countries which had better health health standerds had  even the highest infections and death rates. Looking at the after effects of COVID 19 in countries like US and Canada as well as China, which are countries well known to have the economic and political muscles to wrestle the pandemic, it then calls for a deep dive into the less developed. It is against this background that a deep dive into COVID 19 in Africa became a neccessity of this project.
